when ever we try to pass ticket.requeted_end_date from Angular to RestAPI,
it's taking 1 day off to the passed date value!
Figure out the reason and Fix it


Implement Admin Functionalities


-------------------

Extract all the common rest calls and put them in Shared Folder!

getPriorities 
getListOfUsers etc...

put a Add User button in ShowUsers Component
make it as a toggle button to show AddUser Component

Then user can fill the details and click "Add User" button

then make restcall from AddUser -> onSubmit() -> _adminServices
then navigate to "admin/showUsers", to display the updated Users!


Apply the same strategy to All the Functionalities
